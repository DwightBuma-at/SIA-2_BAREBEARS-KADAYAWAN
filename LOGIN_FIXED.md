# ✅ LOGIN SYSTEM FIXED!

## What Was Wrong
Your login system was trying to authenticate users through **Supabase** (cloud service), but the users only existed in your local SQLite database. This caused login failures.

## What I Fixed
✅ Modified `myProject/myApp/views.py` to use **local Django authentication**  
✅ Verified all 3 user accounts have correct passwords  
✅ Updated both login and signup functions  

## 🔐 Working Login Credentials

All passwords are verified and working:

### Admin Account
- **Email:** `admin@admin.com`
- **Password:** `admin123`
- **Access:** Admin Dashboard (full privileges)

### Staff Account
- **Email:** `staff@staff.com`
- **Password:** `staff123`
- **Access:** Staff Dashboard

### User Account
- **Email:** `user@gmail.com`
- **Password:** `user123`
- **Access:** User Dashboard

## 🚀 How to Start the Server

In your terminal (with virtual environment activated):

```powershell
cd myProject
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see:
```

```

## 🌐 Access Your Application

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: **http://localhost:8000**
3. Click on Login
4. Use any of the credentials above

## ✅ Login Flow

1. **Admin Login** → Redirects to `/admin-dashboard/`
2. **Staff Login** → Redirects to `/staff-dashboard/`
3. **User Login** → Redirects to `/user-dashboard/`

## 📋 Available Features by Role

### Admin Dashboard (`admin@admin.com`)
- View/Edit Inventory
- Manage Orders (Online & POS)
- Handle Bookings
- Purchase Order Management
- View All Logs & Reports
- Full System Access

### Staff Dashboard (`staff@staff.com`)

- Manage Bookings
- View Order Tracking

### User Dashboard (`user@gmail.com`)

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### File: `myProject/myApp/views.py`

**Before (Supabase Authentication):**
```python
response = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_password({
    'email': email,
    'password': password
})
```

**After (Local Authentication):**
```python
user = Signup.objects.get(email=email)
if user.check_password(password):
    request.session['user_email'] = email
    # Login successful
```

## 🧪 Verified Working

I created a test script that confirmed:
- ✅ Admin password `admin123` - **CORRECT**
- ✅ Staff password `staff123` - **CORRECT**  
- ✅ User password `user123` - **CORRECT**

All accounts are in the database and ready to use!

## 📝 New User Registration

The signup page now works with local authentication too. New users can register and will be saved to the local database without needing Supabase.

## 🎯 Test Your Login Now!

1. Make sure server is running: `cd myProject; python manage.py runserver`
2. Open: http://localhost:8000
3. Click "Login"
4. Use: `admin@admin.com` / `admin123`
5. You should be redirected to the Admin Dashboard!
